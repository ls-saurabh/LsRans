**Description:**

This is a simple file encryption and decryption tool written in Python. The tool provides a convenient way to encrypt files using AES encryption and decrypt them when needed. It consists of two main components: an encryption script (`encrypt.py`) and a decryption script (`decrypt.py`).

**Features:**

- **AES Encryption:** Utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, a symmetric encryption algorithm known for its security and efficiency.
- **File-Level Encryption:** Allows users to encrypt individual files or entire directories securely.
- **Automatic Decryption Script:** Generates a decryption script (`decrypt.py`) alongside the encryption process, enabling easy decryption of encrypted files.
- **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling to gracefully handle exceptions during file operations, encryption, and decryption.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Written in Python, making it compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Executable Creation:** Can be packaged into standalone executables (`.exe` files) using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze for easier distribution and usage on systems without Python installed.
- **Security:** Encourages secure handling of encryption keys and sensitive information to protect encrypted data from unauthorized access.

**Usage:**

1. **Encryption:** Run the `encrypt.py` script, providing the directory or file(s) you wish to encrypt as arguments.
2. **Decryption:** Execute the `decrypt.py` script in the directory containing the encrypted files and their corresponding key files (`.key`), or specify the directory as an argument.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LsRans.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd LsRans`
3. Install dependencies (if any): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the encryption script: `python encrypt.py`
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt your files.
6. To decrypt files, execute the decryption script: `python decrypt.py`
